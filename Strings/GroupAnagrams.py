#QUESTION:
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
Example 1:
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

#CODE: O(NKlogK) [ NOTE: N-len of strs, K-len of each str, we sort each str in KLOGK times hence complexity is O(NKLogK)]
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        ans = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            ans[tuple(sorted(s))].append(s)
        return ans.values()
